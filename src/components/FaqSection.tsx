    question: "Do I need both the add-on and dashboard?",
    answer: "You get both! Use whichever fits your workflow. Many users start with sheets and fall in love with the dashboard for client presentations."
  },
  {
    question: "Will this work with my existing GSC setup?",
    answer: "Yes! Works with any Google Search Console account. No changes needed to your current setup."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I hit 75,000 rows?",
    answer: "That covers 99% of websites. If you need more, we'll work out a custom solution that's still way cheaper than monthly tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this really built by an SEO?",
    answer: "Yep! 8 years in the trenches. Every feature exists because I needed it myself."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I hate it?",
    answer: "60-day refund. But you won't hate it â€“ you'll wonder how you lived without it."
